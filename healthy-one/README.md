# project3 Full Stack Application
            Healthy-One

Healthy-One is hoped to be a full stack application that will not only offer a sense of community and companionship for those going through medical hardships, but also offers a platform to help intergrate medical care.

While working in the medical field I saw a need for a one stop shop for patients. Although most hospitals do offer patient educationand support it is usually on the hospitals terms, and in hospital setting on their clock. With this application the patient will have the access with in the palm of there hand.

But wait... theres more. Though I have seen the nurses view , I was/am also a patient. I currently live with two autoimmune diseases. From the ages of 26 to 28 I was primarly bedridden due these diseases. During this time I saw very clearly the major problems with our health care system from the patients view. One of the largest problems was dealing with hospitals on seperate networks. Once I exhausted all my resources with little to no answers and/or relief, I started to pursue out of network doctors... this process took months. Not anything to do with insurance issues but medical records. You can tell someone until you're blue in the face what medications and treatments you've tried, but without the access to your medical records everything comes to a hault. 

Hopes are with this application not only can we offer patient eduction and support, but also speedup the treatment process.
